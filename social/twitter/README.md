node-red-node-twitter
=====================

<a href="http://nodered.org" target="_new">Node-RED</a> nodes to talk to Twitter.

The Twitter API will **NOT** deliver 100% of all tweets. This does **NOT** give access to the Twitter Firehose.

Tweets of who you follow will include their retweets and favourites.

Install
-------

Run the following command in your Node-RED user directory - typically `~/.node-red`

        npm install node-red-node-twitter

Usage
-----

Provides two nodes - one to receive messages, and one to send.

### Input

Twitter input node. Can be used to search either:

 - the public or a user's stream for tweets containing the configured search term
 - all tweets by specific users
 - direct messages received by the authenticated user

Use **space** for *and*, and **comma** , for *or* when searching for multiple terms.

Sets the `msg.topic` to *tweets/* and then appends the senders screen name.

Sets `msg.location` to the tweeters location if known.

When returning events it sets the `msg.payload` to the twitter event, a full list is documented by
<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview/messages-types#Events_event" target="_new">Twitter</a>.

Sets `msg.tweet` to the full tweet object as documented by <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/tweets" target="_new">Twitter</a>.

**Note**: This node is not connected to the FireHose, so will not return 100% of all tweets to a busy @id or #hashtag.

Sets `msg.tweet` to the full tweet object as documented by <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/tweets">Twitter</a>.

**Note**: when set to a specific user's tweets, or your direct messages, the node is subject to
Twitter's API rate limiting. If you deploy the flows multiple times within a 15 minute window, you may
exceed the limit and will see errors from the node. These errors will clear when the current 15 minute window
passes.


### Output

Tweets the `msg.payload`.

To send a Direct Message (DM) - use a payload like.

        D {username} {message}

If `msg.media` exists and is a Buffer object, this node will treat it as an image and attach it to the tweet.

If `msg.params` exists and is an object of name:value pairs, this node will treat it as parameters for the update request.

#### Retweet

To retweet an existing tweet, set `msg.retweet` to the tweet id. The tweet id can be found in the `id_str` field of the tweet object.

Before retweeting, make sure the tweet is not a retweet itself.
